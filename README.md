# Universal Object Detector

---

## Project Description  
**UniversalObjectDetector** is a flexible and high-performance object detection framework that supports multiple detection techniques, including **Haar Cascades**, **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**, and **custom Machine Learning models**. Designed for both images and real-time video streams, it provides precise and efficient object recognition while maintaining a modular structure for easy extension and optimization.  

This project is divided into three main components:  
- **Core**: Defines object models, interfaces, and essential utility functions.  
- **Detectors**: Implements various detection algorithms, making it easy to integrate new models.  
- **App**: A console-based application demonstrating real-time object detection.

## Features  

- **Multi-Model Support**
- – Integrates Haar Cascades, YOLO, and ML-based detection.
- 
- **Real-Time Processing**
- – Detects objects in live video feeds from webcams.
- 
- **Image-Based Detection**
-  – Works with static images as well as video streams.
-   
- ⚙**Modular and Extensible**
- – Easily add new detection methods and configurations.
-  
- **Configurable Resources**
- – Supports external model files, configuration settings, and datasets.

## Setup and Usage  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/UniversalObjectDetector.git
cd UniversalObjectDetector
```

### 2️⃣ Build and Run  
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.  
2. Restore NuGet dependencies:  
   ```sh
   dotnet restore
   ```  
3. Run the console application:  
   ```sh
   dotnet run --project UniversalObjectDetector.App
   ```

### 3️⃣ Configuration  
- Place Haar cascade XML files in `resources/cascades/`.  
- Store YOLO model files (`.cfg`, `.weights`) in `resources/models/`.  
- Edit `config.json` to switch between different detection methods.
